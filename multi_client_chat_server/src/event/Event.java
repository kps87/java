/**
 * events are used as the basis of maintaining connection status and relaying
 * messages within and between clients and servers. Each Event has type, time,
 * text and serviced fields. The type varies depending on the type of event that
 * occurred and is used to distinguish between general status update events, and
 * more specific connection, incoming message, and outgoing message events. The
 * time field dictates when an event occurred, and the text field is some
 * messages associated with the event (a user message, or an internally
 * generated one). The serviced field is boolean â€“ if serviced is true, the
 * threaded method which monitor event logs throughout the application do not
 * need to act or have already acted on the event and set serviced to true. If
 * serviced is false it means that a monitor/thread somewhere in the application
 * must service the event or carry out some action which facilitates
 * client-to-client or client-server communication.
